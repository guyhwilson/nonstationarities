%Define an initial decoder and initial neural tuning properties (mean
%firing rates and preferred directions).
nUnits = 100;

%The first column of initialTuning is the means, and the second two columns
%are the preferred directions. We make sure that the last two columns are
%orthogonal (uniformly distributed PDs) and that the tuning strength is set
%to 1 (norm of the column is 1). 
initialTuning = randn(nUnits, 3); 
[initialTuning(:,2:3), R] = qr(initialTuning(:,2:3), 0);

%The following is a really simple way to build a linear decoder based on
%the above tuning properties. First we define some velocity vectors
%(calVelocity), then simulate neural tuning to those vectors (calNeural),
%and finally use ordinary least squares regression to find a decoder (D) that
%predicts calVelocity from calNeural.
nTrainingSteps = 10000;
calVelocity = randn(nTrainingSteps, 2);
calNeural = calVelocity*initialTuning(:,2:3)' + initialTuning(:,1)';
calNeural = calNeural + randn(size(calNeural))*0.3;

D = [ones(size(calNeural,1),1), calNeural] \ calVelocity;

%Normalize the gain of this decoder so that it will output vectors with a
%magnitude of 1 when the encoded velocity has a magnitude of 1. 
D(:,1) = D(:,1) / norm(D(2:end,1)) / norm(initialTuning(:,2));
D(:,2) = D(:,2) / norm(D(2:end,2)) / norm(initialTuning(:,3));

%Here we define the amount of exponential smoothing used in the decoder (alpha). Values
%between 0.9 and 0.96 are pretty reasonable. See the paper 
%'A comparison of intention estimation methods for decoder calibration in
%intracortical brainâ€“computer interfaces' for an explanation of how velocity Kalman
%filters can be parameterized with a smoothing parameter (alpha), gain
%parameter (beta, see next section below) and decoding matrix (D). 
alpha = 0.94;

%define the time step (10 ms)
delT = 0.01;

%define the simulated user's visual feedback delay (200 ms)

%Do a quick sweep of cursor gains to find the optimal one for this task. This is
%really important so that any new recalibration algorithm doesn't improve
%performance simply by coincidence, via randomly changing the gain to some better
%value.

%The task we are simulating is a fitts style task where targets randomly
%appear within a box centered at the origin. To acquire the target, the
%user must hold the cursor on top of the target for half a second. The
%performance metric of interest is the average total trial time (TTT), or
%the average amount of time it takes to reach to and fully hold on a target. 

%The 'simulateBCIFitts' does all the work of simulating the BCI user, the
%neural activity, and the decoder. It returns time series data you can use
%to see the cursor trajectory and target locations (posTraj & velTraj are
%the cursor positions and velocities, rawDecTraj is the raw decoded
%velocity vectors before they are smoothed, conTraj is the user's internal
%control vector, targTraj is a time series of target locations, neuralTraj
%is a time series of neural activity, trialStart contains the time step on
%which each trial started, and ttt has the trial time (in seconds) for each
%trial.
